**Step 01. Data Description:** My goal is to use statistics metrics to identify data outside the scope of business.

**Step 02. Feature Engineering:** Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled.

**Step 03. Data Filtering:** Filter rows and select columns that do not contain information for modeling or that do not match the scope of the business.

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.

**Step 05. Data Preparation:** Prepare the data so that the Machine Learning models can learn the specific behavior.

**Step 06. Feature Selection:** Selection of the most significant attributes for training the model.

**Step 07. Machine Learning Modelling:** Machine Learning model training

**Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tunning:** Choose the best values for each of the parameters of the model selected from the previous step.

**Step 09. Convert Model Performance to Business Values:** Convert the performance of the Machine Learning model into a business result.

**Step 10. Deploy Modelo to Production:** Publish the model in a cloud environment so that other people or services can use the results to improve the business decision.
